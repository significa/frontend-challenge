# About the challenges

These challenges are made for those who – for any reason – don't have any project or code samples that allows us to analyse and evaluate their capabilities with accuracy.

We know that, in certain cases, these challenges have to be solved in your own personal free time, so we tried our best to make them as easy or as complex as you decide to make them, hopefully without having too much impact in your personal life. Most times, even an incomplete challenge can give us enough information on what you're capable of.

## Challenges

You can use any boilerplate/approach you prefer, but try to keep it simple. We encourage you to use your favourite tools and packages to build the best app possible.

### A) Movie search

This challenge is more data-driven. You will have to build an app that lists movies and shows some details.

- **[Movie search instructions](/movie-search)**

### B) UI Challenges

These challenges are more design-driven. Attention to detail and perfectionism is what we're looking for.

Choose one of the following:

- **[Audio player](/audio-player)**
- **[Calendar picker](/calendar-picker)**

1. Solve the challenge in the best way you can;
1. Send us an email to development@significa.co with a zip of your code or a link to your repo.

### Tips

- Write a good README with basic information (e.g.: how to start the project and how to build it);
- Asking questions is good. We will not penalize you for asking questions;
- We're looking for signs you understand concepts such as events, promises, and reactivity, and how those concepts are implemented in Javascript;
- Unit testing will be greatly valued;
