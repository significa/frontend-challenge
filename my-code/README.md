*** This project was built for studying purposes. ***

## Tools and packages used

* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com)
* [ESLint](https://eslint.org)
* [Prettier](https://prettier.io)
* [React Redux](https://react-redux.js.org/)
* [React Router DOM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-router-dom)
* [Styled Components](https://www.styled-components.com)
* [Axios](https://github.com/axios/axios)

## Considerations

* This is a responsive app.
* Showing the movie posters in a grid was a design challenge because they not always have exactly the same height.
  Also, some movies doesn't even have a poster.
  So a div with fixed height aproach was used with the poster image as a background.
* React Hooks React Redux were used.
* After the first search, the results are stored in the browser's local storage and restore on page load. Reload at will! :)
  The favourites list is also saved in the browser's local storage.
* A clear search button was added to the search field.
* A pagination was used.
* A quick fade in effect was used in the movie posters.
* I tried my best to make the like buttons one single component. I think I did a good job.
* No tests provided (lack of knowledge).

## Installing dependencies

This uses yarn as the package manager. Just run `yarn` in the project directory to install the dependencies.

## Running in a development environment

In the project directory, you can run:

`yarn start`

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

## Running in a production environment

In the project directory, you can run:

`yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.

Then `yarn global add serve` and `serve -s build` to access the production version.

*** Below is the original README.md file generated by Creat Reat App. ***

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
