# Movie search

This app should be a movie search with two pages:

- **Home page:** search field and a list with the results;  
  _Think about empty state, loading state and movie not found_
- **Movie page:** movie details page;  
  _Think about loading state and movie not found_

The purpose of this challenge is to evaluate your HTML, CSS, Javascript and API skills and overall approach while composing a simple web app given a set of screens and an API feed.

## Main skills

1. Writing a solid application
2. Making API calls
3. Filter data and shape it to display on the UI
4. How well you improvise the app design

## What is expected

- A functional app with the two screens (`Home` and `Details`);
- A clean layout and design;
- A way to tag movies as _favourites_ (and having them persist would be great!);

## Necessary information

We suggest using [OMDb API](http://www.omdbapi.com/), although you can use any other API you prefer
